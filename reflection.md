What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

*I worked with Liberty Lehr and Nathalie Trouba on this assignment. We were not able to figure out how to collaborate on a single repository.

The hardest part about this assignment was figuring out where to start. We were not sure how much we actually needed to change the source code; at first we thought we were only supposed to move things around. This is mostly what caused us to take the extension. 

What eventually worked for us was to keep the Computer class very simple (just a constructor and create_computer) and carry over the functions from procedural_resale_shop almost directly into oo_resale_shop. I think this was a good strategy because it makes sense that the Resale Shop class would be more sophisticated than the Computer class, as it manages many different computers--all of which have the same basic structure. We then started the process of integrating the concept of inventory into oo_resale_shop and tweaking the functions to work within their respective classes. Finally, we tested the functions, which revealed issues with our code and allowed us to debug. 

If I were to give advice to someone taking this course in the future, I would say to collaborate--especially on conceptual assignments like this. It was so helpful to bounce my ideas off of my partners! Also, I might add that trial and error is almost always a viable way to work through problems. Even if you are not sure that something will work, try it out and see what happens. That mindset really helped me crack the particulars of this assignment.
